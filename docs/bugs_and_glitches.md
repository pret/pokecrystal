# Bugs and Glitches

These are known bugs and glitches in the original Pokémon Crystal game: code that clearly does not work as intended, or that only works in limited circumstances but has the possibility to fail or crash.

Fixes are written in the `diff` format. If you've used Git before, this should look familiar:

```diff
 this is some code
-delete red - lines
+add green + lines
```

Fixes in the [multi-player battle engine](#multi-player-battle-engine) category will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal for link battles. This can be avoided by writing more complicated fixes that only apply if the value at `[wLinkMode]` is not `LINK_COLOSSEUM`. That's how Crystal itself fixed two bugs in Gold and Silver regarding the moves [Reflect and Light Screen](#reflect-and-light-screen-can-make-special-defense-wrap-around-above-1024) and [Present](#present-damage-is-incorrect-in-link-battles).

## Multi-player battle engine


### Perish Song and Spikes can leave a Pokémon with 0 HP and not faint

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IiPWw5fMf8&t=85))

**Fix:** Edit `CheckFaint_PlayerThenEnemy` and `CheckFaint_EnemyThenPlayer` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 	jp HandleEncore

### Thick Club and Light Ball can make (Special) Attack wrap around above 1024

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGqu3d3pdok&t=450))

**Fix:** Edit `SpeciesItemBoost` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 ; Double the stat
-; BUG: Thick Club and Light Ball can make (Special) Attack wrap around above 1024 (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

+	ret nz

+	cp l
+	ret nc
+

+	ld hl, MAX_STAT_VALUE
 	ret
```


### Metal Powder can increase damage taken with boosted (Special) Defense

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGqu3d3pdok&t=450))

**Fix:** Edit [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 DittoMetalPowder:
 	...

-; BUG: Metal Powder can increase damage taken with boosted (Special) Defense (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

-	srl a
-	add c

```

```diff

 	call TruncateHL_BC

 	ld a, [wBattleMonLevel]
 	ld e, a

 	and a
 	ret
```

```diff

 	call TruncateHL_BC

 	ld a, [wBattleMonLevel]
 	ld e, a

 	ld a, 1
 	and a
 	ret
```


### Reflect and Light Screen can make (Special) Defense wrap around above 1024

This bug existed for all battles in Gold and Silver, and was only fixed for single-player battles in Crystal to preserve link compatibility.

**Fix:** Edit `TruncateHL_BC` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 .finish
-; BUG: Reflect and Light Screen can make (Special) Defense wrap around above 1024 (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
-	ld a, [wLinkMode]
-	cp LINK_COLOSSEUM
-	jr z, .done
 ; If we go back to the loop point,
 ; it's the same as doing this exact
 ; same check twice.
 	ld a, h
 	or b
 	jr nz, .loop

-.done
 	ld b, l
 	ret
```

(This fix also affects Thick Club, Light Ball, and Metal Powder, as described above, but their specific fixes in the above bugs allow more accurate damage calculations.)


### Moves with a 100% secondary effect chance will not trigger it in 1/256 uses

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHkyO5T5wZU&t=206))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_EffectChance` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 .got_move_chance
-; BUG: Moves with a 100% secondary effect chance will not trigger it in 1/256 uses (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
-	call BattleRandom
+	ld a, [hl]
+	sub 100 percent
+	; If chance was 100%, RNG won't be called (carry not set)
+	; Thus chance will be subtracted from 0, guaranteeing a carry
+	call c, BattleRandom
 	cp [hl]
 	pop hl
 	ret c

 .failed
 	ld a, 1
 	ld [wEffectFailed], a
 	and a
 	ret
```

**Compatibility preservation:** If you wish to keep compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal, you can disable the fix during link battles by also applying the following edit in the same place:

```diff
+	ld a, [wLinkMode]
+	cp LINK_COLOSSEUM
+	scf ; Force RNG to be called
+	jr z, .nofix ; Don't apply fix in link battles, for compatibility
 	ld a, [hl]
 	sub 100 percent
 	; If chance was 100%, RNG won't be called (carry not set)
 	; Thus chance will be subtracted from 0, guaranteeing a carry
+.nofix
 	call c, BattleRandom
```

### Belly Drum sharply boosts Attack even with under 50% HP

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuCLMikWo4Y))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_BellyDrum` in [engine/battle/move_effects/belly_drum.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/belly_drum.asm):

```diff
 BattleCommand_BellyDrum:
-; BUG: Belly Drum sharply boosts Attack even with under 50% HP (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
-	call BattleCommand_AttackUp2
-	ld a, [wAttackMissed]
-	and a
-	jr nz, .failed
-
 	callfar GetHalfMaxHP
 	callfar CheckUserHasEnoughHP
 	jr nc, .failed
+
+	push bc
+	call BattleCommand_AttackUp2
+	pop bc
+	ld a, [wAttackMissed]
+	and a
+	jr nz, .failed
```


### Berserk Gene's confusion lasts for 256 turns or the previous Pokémon's confusion count

([Video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pru3mohq20A))

**Fix:** Edit `HandleBerserkGene` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 HandleBerserkGene:
 	...
-; BUG: Berserk Gene's confusion lasts for 256 turns or the previous Pokémon's confusion count (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	ld a, BATTLE_VARS_SUBSTATUS3
 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	push af
 	set SUBSTATUS_CONFUSED, [hl]
+	ldh a, [hBattleTurn]
+	and a
+	ld hl, wPlayerConfuseCount
+	jr z, .set_confuse_count
+	ld hl, wEnemyConfuseCount
+.set_confuse_count
+	call BattleRandom
+	and %11
+	add 2
+	ld [hl], a
 	ld a, BATTLE_VARS_MOVE_ANIM
 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	...
```

This makes the Berserk Gene use the regular confusion duration (2–5 turns).


### Confusion damage is affected by type-boosting items and Explosion/Self-Destruct doubling

([Video](https://twitter.com/crystal_rby/status/874626362287562752))

**Fix:**

First, edit [wram.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/ram/wram.asm):

```diff
 wTurnEnded:: db

-	ds 1
+wIsConfusionDamage:: db

 wPlayerStats::
```

Then edit four routines in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 HitSelfInConfusion:
 	...
 	call TruncateHL_BC
 	ld d, 40
 	pop af
 	ld e, a
+	ld a, TRUE
+	ld [wIsConfusionDamage], a
 	ret
```

```diff
 BattleCommand_DamageCalc:
 ; Return a damage value for move power d, player level e, enemy defense c and player attack b.
-; BUG: Confusion damage is affected by type-boosting items and Explosion/Self-Destruct doubling (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	...
 .skip_zero_damage_check
+	xor a ; Not confusion damage
+	ld [wIsConfusionDamage], a
+	; fallthrough

 	...

 ; Item boosts
+
+; Item boosts don't apply to confusion damage
+	ld a, [wIsConfusionDamage]
+	and a
+	jr nz, .DoneItem
+
 	call GetUserItem

 	...
```

```diff
 CheckEnemyTurn:
 	...

 	ld hl, HurtItselfText
 	call StdBattleTextbox

 	call HitSelfInConfusion
-	call BattleCommand_DamageCalc
+	call ConfusionDamageCalc
 	call BattleCommand_LowerSub

 	...
```

```diff

 	xor a
 	ld [wCriticalHit], a

 	call HitSelfInConfusion

 	call BattleCommand_LowerSub
```


### Moves that lower Defense can do so after breaking a Substitute

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwKPRJLaaI))

This bug affects Acid, Iron Tail, and Rock Smash.

**Fix:** Edit `DefenseDownHit` in [data/moves/effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/data/moves/effects.asm):

```diff
 DefenseDownHit:
 	checkobedience
 	usedmovetext

 	statdownmessage
 	endmove
```


### Counter and Mirror Coat still work if the opponent uses an item

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRYyzKRatFk))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_Counter` in [engine/battle/move_effects/counter.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/counter.asm) and `BattleCommand_MirrorCoat` in [engine/battle/move_effects/mirror_coat.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/mirror_coat.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Counter and Mirror Coat still work if the opponent uses an item (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	ld hl, wCurDamage
 	ld a, [hli]
 	or [hl]
-	ret z
+	jr z, .failed
```

Add this to the end of each file:

```diff
+.failed
+	ld a, 1
+	ld [wEffectFailed], a
+	and a
+	ret
```


### A Disabled but PP Up–enhanced move may not trigger Struggle

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9x4SgMggs))

**Fix:** Edit `CheckPlayerHasUsableMoves` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 .done
-; BUG: A Disabled but PP Up–enhanced move may not trigger Struggle (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
-	and a
+	and PP_MASK
 	ret nz

 .force_struggle
 	ld hl, BattleText_MonHasNoMovesLeft

 	call DelayFrames
 	xor a
 	ret
```


### A Pokémon that fainted from Pursuit will have its old status condition when revived

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiRvw-Nb2ME))

**Fix:** Edit `PursuitSwitch` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: A Pokémon that fainted from Pursuit will have its old status condition when revived (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

### Lock-On and Mind Reader don't always bypass Fly and Dig

This bug affects Attract, Curse, Foresight, Mean Look, Mimic, Nightmare, Spider Web, Transform, and stat-lowering effects of moves like String Shot or Bubble during the semi-invulnerable turn of Fly or Dig.

**Fix:** Edit `CheckHiddenOpponent` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff

### Beat Up can desynchronize link battles

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=202-iAsrIa8))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_BeatUp` in [engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm):

```diff

### Beat Up works incorrectly with only one Pokémon in the party

This bug prevents the rest of Beat Up's effect from being executed if the player or enemy only has one Pokémon in their party while using it. It prevents Substitute from being raised and King's Rock from working.

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_EndLoop` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 .only_one_beatup
-; BUG: Beat Up works incorrectly with only one Pokémon in the party (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	res SUBSTATUS_IN_LOOP, [hl]
-	call BattleCommand_BeatUpFailText
-	jp EndMoveEffect

```

**Cosmetic fix:** This fix does not break compatibility, but it only affects what's shown on the screen for the patched game.

```diff
 .only_one_beatup
 ; BUG: Beat Up works incorrectly with only one Pokemon in the party (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

```


### Beat Up may trigger King's Rock even if it failed

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_BeatUpFailText` in [engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm):

```diff

### Present damage is incorrect in link battles

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJaQoKtrEuw))

This bug existed for all battles in Gold and Silver, and was only fixed for single-player battles in Crystal to preserve link compatibility.

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_Present` in [engine/battle/move_effects/present.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/present.asm):

```diff
 BattleCommand_Present:
-; BUG: Present damage is incorrect in link battles (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

### Return and Frustration deal no damage when the user's happiness is low or high, respectively

This happens because the user's happiness (or 255 − happiness for Frustration) is multiplied by 10 and divided by 25, which rounds down to zero when the happiness is 0–2 (or 253–255 for Frustration).

**Fix:**

Edit [engine/battle/move_effects/return.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/return.asm):

```diff
 BattleCommand_HappinessPower:
-; BUG: Return and Frustration deal no damage when the user's happiness is low or high, respectively (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

```

And edit [engine/battle/move_effects/frustration.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/frustration.asm):

```diff

### Dragon Scale, not Dragon Fang, boosts Dragon-type moves

**Fix:** Edit `ItemAttributes` in [data/items/attributes.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/data/items/attributes.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Dragon Scale, not Dragon Fang, boosts Dragon-type moves (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

```


### Switching out or switching against a Pokémon with max HP below 4 freezes the game

This happens because switching involves calculating a percentage of maximum enemy HP. Directly calculating *HP* × 100 / *max HP* would require a two-byte denominator, so instead the game calculates *HP* × 25 / (*max HP* / 4), since even a maximum HP of 999 divided by 4 is 249, which fits in one byte. However, if the maximum HP is below 4 this will divide by 0, which enters an infinite loop in `_Divide`.

**Fix:** First, edit `SendOutMonText` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Switching out or switching against a Pokémon with max HP below 4 freezes the game (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	; compute enemy health remaining as a percentage
 	xor a
 	ldh [hMultiplicand + 0], a
 	ld hl, wEnemyMonHP
 	ld a, [hli]
 	ld [wEnemyHPAtTimeOfPlayerSwitch], a
 	ldh [hMultiplicand + 1], a
 	ld a, [hl]
 	ld [wEnemyHPAtTimeOfPlayerSwitch + 1], a
 	ldh [hMultiplicand + 2], a
-	ld a, 25
-	ldh [hMultiplier], a
-	call Multiply
 	ld hl, wEnemyMonMaxHP
 	ld a, [hli]
 	ld b, [hl]
-	srl a
-	rr b
-	srl a
-	rr b
+	ld c, 100
+	and a
+	jr z, .shift_done
+.shift
+	rra
+	rr b
+	srl c
+	and a
+	jr nz, .shift
+.shift_done
+	ld a, c
+	ldh [hMultiplier], a
+	call Multiply
 	ld a, b
 	ld b, 4
 	ldh [hDivisor], a
 	call Divide
```

Then edit `WithdrawMonText` in the same file:

```diff
 	; compute enemy health lost as a percentage
 	ld hl, wEnemyMonHP + 1
 	ld de, wEnemyHPAtTimeOfPlayerSwitch + 1
 	ld b, [hl]
 	dec hl
 	ld a, [de]
 	sub b
 	ldh [hMultiplicand + 2], a
 	dec de
 	ld b, [hl]
 	ld a, [de]
 	sbc b
 	ldh [hMultiplicand + 1], a
-	ld a, 25
-	ldh [hMultiplier], a
-	call Multiply
 	ld hl, wEnemyMonMaxHP
 	ld a, [hli]
 	ld b, [hl]
-	srl a
-	rr b
-	srl a
-	rr b
+	ld c, 100
+	and a
+	jr z, .shift_done
+.shift
+	rra
+	rr b
+	srl c
+	and a
+	jr nz, .shift
+.shift_done
+	ld a, c
+	ldh [hMultiplier], a
+	call Multiply
 	ld a, b
 	ld b, 4
 	ldh [hDivisor], a
 	call Divide
```

This changes both calculations to *HP* × (100 / *N*) / (*max HP* / *N*) for the smallest necessary *N*, which will be at least 1, so it avoids dividing by zero and is also more accurate.


### Moves that do damage and increase your stats do not increase stats after a KO

`BattleCommand_CheckFaint` "ends the move effect if the opponent faints", and these moves attempt to raise the user's stats *after* `checkfaint`. Note that fixing this can lead to stats being increased at the end of battle, but will not have any negative effects.

**Fix:** Edit [data/moves/effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/data/moves/effects.asm):

```diff

 	...
 	criticaltext
 	supereffectivetext

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_Sketch` in [engine/battle/move_effects/sketch.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/sketch.asm):

```diff

### The Dude's catching tutorial may crash if his Poké Ball can't be used

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8zaTOkjKS4&t=407))

This can occur if your party and current PC box are both full when you start the tutorial.

**Fix:** Edit `PokeBallEffect` in [engine/items/item_effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/items/item_effects.asm):

```diff

### BRN/PSN/PAR do not affect catch rate

### Moon Ball does not boost catch rate

The Moon Ball checks the wrong memory address for the wrong item ID, so no Pokémon can receive the boost.

**Fix:** Edit `MoonBallMultiplier` in [engine/items/item_effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/items/item_effects.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Moon Ball does not boost catch rate (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

 	ld a, BANK("Evolutions and Attacks")
 	call GetFarByte
-	cp MOON_STONE_RED ; BURN_HEAL

 	ret nz
```

Note that this fix only accounts for Pokémon that evolve via Moon Stone as their first evolution method. However, that is sufficient to cover all Pokémon in the game that can evolve by Moon Stone.


### Love Ball boosts catch rate for the wrong gender

**Fix:** Edit `LoveBallMultiplier` in [engine/items/item_effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/items/item_effects.asm):

### Fast Ball only boosts catch rate for three Pokémon

### Heavy Ball uses wrong weight value for three Pokémon

`HeavyBall_GetDexEntryBank` gets the wrong bank for Kadabra (64), Tauros (128), and Sunflora (192).

```


### PRZ and BRN stat reductions don't apply to switched Pokémon

This does not affect link battles or Battle Tower battles because those jump from `LoadEnemyMon` to `InitEnemyMon`, which already calls `ApplyStatusEffectOnEnemyStats`.

**Fix:** Edit `LoadEnemyMon` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 	ld hl, wEnemyMonStats

### Glacier Badge may not boost Special Defense depending on the value of Special Attack

Pryce's dialog ("That BADGE will raise the SPECIAL stats of POKéMON.") implies that Glacier Badge is intended to boost both Special Attack and Special Defense, but the Special Defense boost will not happen unless the unboosted Special Attack stat is 206–432, or 661 or above.

**Fix:** Edit `BadgeStatBoosts.CheckBadge` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff

**Fix:** Edit `EnemyUsedFullRestore`, and `AI_HealStatus` in [engine/battle/ai/items.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/ai/items.asm):

```diff
 EnemyUsedFullRestore:
-; BUG: AI use of Full Heal does not cure confusion status (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	call AI_HealStatus
 	ld a, FULL_RESTORE
 	ld [wCurEnemyItem], a

- 	ld [wEnemyConfuseCount], a
 	; fallthrough
```

```diff
 AI_HealStatus:

 	ld hl, wEnemySubStatus5
 	res SUBSTATUS_TOXIC, [hl]
 	ret
```

### AI might use its base reward value as an item

In the `AI_TryItem` routine, an item pointer is set to `wEnemyTrainerItem1` and then increments to `wEnemyTrainerItem2` to see if either of the AI's items are in the `AI_Items` list. However, if the AI has used its first item (or its first one is `ITEM_NONE`) and hasn't used its second item, the item pointer can increment from `wEnemyTrainerItem2` to `wEnemyTrainerBaseReward`. If the value at this address then matches an item in the `AI_Items` list, the AI could mistakenly use it.

**Fix:** Edit `AI_TryItem` in [engine/battle/ai/items.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/ai/items.asm):

```diff
 AI_TryItem:
  	...
 	ld a, [wTrainerClass]
 	dec a
 	ld hl, TrainerClassAttributes + TRNATTR_AI_ITEM_SWITCH
 	ld bc, NUM_TRAINER_ATTRIBUTES

 	ld a, [hl]
 	and a
 	inc a
 	ret z
```


### Wild Pokémon can always Teleport regardless of level difference

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_Teleport` in [engine/battle/move_effects/teleport.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/teleport.asm):

```diff
 .loop_enemy
-; BUG: Wild Pokémon can always Teleport regardless of level difference (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
+; If a random number >= player level / 4, Teleport will succeed
 	call BattleRandom
 	cp c
 	jr nc, .loop_enemy
 	; b = player level / 4
 	srl b
 	srl b
 	cp b
-	jr nc, .run_away
+	jr c, .failed
```


### `RIVAL2` has lower DVs than `RIVAL1`

`RIVAL1` is battled throughout the game. `RIVAL2` is battled at Indigo Plateau, and would not be expected to have worse DVs.

**Fix:** Edit `TrainerClassDVs` in [data/trainers/dvs.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/data/trainers/dvs.asm):

```diff
 	dn 13, 13, 13, 13 ; RIVAL1
 	...
-; BUG: RIVAL2 has lower DVs than RIVAL1 (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
-	dn  9,  8,  8,  8 ; RIVAL2
+	dn 13, 13, 13, 13 ; RIVAL2
```


### `HELD_CATCH_CHANCE` has no effect

**Fix:** Edit `PokeBallEffect` in [engine/items/item_effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/items/item_effects.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: HELD_CATCH_CHANCE has no effect (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	ld d, a
 	push de
 	ld a, [wBattleMonItem]
+	ld b, a

```


### Credits sequence changes move selection menu behavior

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjFUo6Jr4po&t=438))

To select a move in battle, you have to press and release the Up or Down buttons. However, after playing the credits sequence, holding down either button will continuously scroll through the moves.

**Fix:** Edit `Credits` in [engine/movie/credits.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/movie/credits.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Credits sequence changes move selection menu behavior (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	ldh a, [hVBlank]
 	push af
 	ld a, VBLANK_CREDITS
 	ldh [hVBlank], a
+	ldh a, [hInMenu]
+	push af
 	ld a, TRUE
 	ldh [hInMenu], a

 	...

 	ldh [hLCDCPointer], a
 	ldh [hBGMapAddress], a
+	pop af
+	ldh [hInMenu], a
 	pop af
 	ldh [hVBlank], a
 	pop af
 	ldh [rSVBK], a
```

The `[hInMenu]` value determines this button behavior. However, the battle moves menu doesn't actually set `[hInMenu]` to anything, so either behavior *may* have been intentional. The default 0 prevents continuous scrolling; a value of 1 allows it. (The Japanese release sets it to 0.)

**Optional fix:** To explicitly set a `[hInMenu]` for the moves menu, edit `BattleTurn` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 BattleTurn:
+	ldh a, [hInMenu]
+	push af
+	ld a, 1 ; or "xor a" for the value 0
+	ldh [hInMenu], a
+
 .loop

 	...

 	jp .loop

 .quit
+	pop af
+	ldh [hInMenu], a
 	ret
```


## Overworld engine


### `LoadMetatiles` wraps around past 128 blocks

This bug prevents you from using blocksets with more than 128 blocks.

**Fix:** Edit `LoadMetatiles` in [home/map.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/home/map.asm):

```diff
 	; Set hl to the address of the current metatile data ([wTilesetBlocksAddress] + (a) tiles).
-; BUG: LoadMetatiles wraps around past 128 blocks (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
-	add a

 	adc h
 	ld h, a
```


### Surfing directly across a map connection does not load the new map

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFOWvMNG-zw))

**Fix:**

First, edit `UsedSurfScript` in [engine/events/overworld.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/events/overworld.asm):

```diff
 UsedSurfScript:
-; BUG: Surfing directly across a map connection does not load the new map (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	writetext UsedSurfText ; "used SURF!"
 	waitbutton
 	closetext

 	callasm .empty_fn ; empty function

 	readmem wSurfingPlayerState
 	writevar VAR_MOVEMENT

 	special UpdatePlayerSprite
 	special PlayMapMusic
-; step into the water (slow_step DIR, step_end)
 	special SurfStartStep
-	applymovement PLAYER, wMovementBuffer
 	end
```

Then edit `SurfStartStep` in [engine/overworld/player_object.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/overworld/player_object.asm):

```diff
 SurfStartStep:
-	call InitMovementBuffer
-	call .GetMovementData
-	call AppendToMovementBuffer
-	ld a, movement_step_end
-	call AppendToMovementBuffer
-	ret
-
-.GetMovementData:
 	ld a, [wPlayerDirection]
 	srl a
 	srl a
 	maskbits NUM_DIRECTIONS
 	ld e, a
 	ld d, 0
 	ld hl, .movement_data
 	add hl, de
-	ld a, [hl]
-	ret
+	add hl, de
+	add hl, de
+	ld a, BANK(.movement_data)
+	jp StartAutoInput

 .movement_data
-	slow_step DOWN
-	slow_step UP
-	slow_step LEFT
-	slow_step RIGHT
+	db D_DOWN,  0, -1
+	db D_UP,    0, -1
+	db D_LEFT,  0, -1
+	db D_RIGHT, 0, -1
```

This fix will make the player enter the water at a normal walking speed, not with a slow step.


### Swimming NPCs aren't limited by their movement radius

This bug is why the Lapras in [maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm), which uses `SPRITEMOVEDATA_SWIM_WANDER`, is not restricted by its `1, 1` movement radius.

**Fix:** Edit `CanObjectMoveInDirection` in [engine/overworld/npc_movement.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/overworld/npc_movement.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: Swimming NPCs aren't limited by their movement radius (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	ld hl, OBJECT_FLAGS1
 	add hl, bc
 	bit NOCLIP_TILES_F, [hl]

### You can fish on top of NPCs

**Fix**: Edit [engine/events/overworld.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/events/overworld.asm):

```diff

### Pokémon deposited in the Day-Care might lose experience

When a Pokémon is withdrawn from the Day-Care, its Exp. Points are reset to the minimum required for its level. This means that if it hadn't gained any levels while in the Day-Care, it may lose experience.

**Fix:** Edit `RetrieveBreedmon` in [engine/pokemon/move_mon.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/pokemon/move_mon.asm):

```diff
 RetrieveBreedmon:

 	...

## Graphics


### In-battle “`…`” ellipsis is too high

This is a mistake with the “`…`” tile in [gfx/battle/hp_exp_bar_border.png](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/gfx/battle/hp_exp_bar_border.png):

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/gfx/battle/hp_exp_bar_border.png)

**Fix:** Lower the ellipsis by two pixels:

### Two tiles in the `port` tileset are drawn incorrectly

This is a mistake with the left-hand warp carpet corner tiles in [gfx/tilesets/port.png](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/gfx/tilesets/port.png):

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/gfx/tilesets/port.png)

**Fix:** Adjust them to match the right-hand corner tiles:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/docs/images/port.png)


### The Ruins of Alph research center's roof color at night looks wrong

The dungeons' map group mostly has indoor maps that don't need roof colors, but [maps/RuinsOfAlphOutside.blk](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/RuinsOfAlphOutside.blk) is an exception. It appears to have poorly-chosen roof colors: the morning/day colors are the same default gray as the unused group 0, and the night colors combine the light default gray and the dark red of Cinnabar's night roofs.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/docs/images/ruins_of_alph_outside.png)

**Fix:** Edit [gfx/tilesets/roofs.pal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/gfx/tilesets/roofs.pal) to use the same red colors as Cinnabar (which are not actually seen in-game):

```diff
 ; group 3 (dungeons)

### Slowpoke Well's stones use the wrong corner tile

This is a mistake with block $5B in the `johto_modern` tileset. The bottom-left corners of the three stones around Slowpoke Well use tile $4B, but should use tile $47.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/docs/images/slowpoke_well.png)

**Fix:** Edit block $5B with [Polished Map](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map) to use the same tiles as block $5C:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/docs/images/slowpoke_well_fixed.png)

### Beat Up may fail to raise Substitute

This bug prevents Substitute from being raised if Beat Up was blocked by Protect or Detect.

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_FailureText` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm).

```diff
-; BUG: Beat Up may fail to raise Substitute (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

**Fix:** Edit `LongAnim_UpdateVariables` in [engine/battle/anim_hp_bar.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/anim_hp_bar.asm):

```diff

### Battle transitions fail to account for the enemy's level

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eij_1060SMc))

There are three things wrong here:

- `wEnemyMonLevel` isn't initialized yet
- `wBattleMonLevel` gets overwritten after it's initialized by `FindFirstAliveMonAndStartBattle`
- `wBattleMonLevel` isn't initialized until much later when the battle is with a trainer

**Fix:**

First, edit [engine/battle/battle_transition.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/battle_transition.asm):

```diff

Then edit [engine/battle/start_battle.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/start_battle.asm):

```diff

Finally, edit [engine/battle/read_trainer_party.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/read_trainer_party.asm):

```diff

### Some trainer NPCs have inconsistent overworld sprites

*Some of these may have been intentional behavior; use your own judgment for whether to fix them.*

Most trainer classes always use the same sprite and color for their overworld NPCs. There are some exceptions:

- [maps/FastShipCabins_SE_SSE_CaptainsCabin.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/FastShipCabins_SE_SSE_CaptainsCabin.asm): `TrainerPsychicRodney` should use `SPRITE_YOUNGSTER`, not `SPRITE_SUPER_NERD`
- [maps/LakeOfRage.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/LakeOfRage.asm): `TrainerFisherAndre` and `TrainerFisherRaymond` should use `PAL_NPC_GREEN`, not `PAL_NPC_BLUE`
- [maps/Route13.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route13.asm): `TrainerHikerKenny` should use `PAL_NPC_BROWN`, not `PAL_NPC_RED`
- [maps/Route44.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route44.asm): `TrainerBirdKeeperVance1` should use `PAL_NPC_BLUE`, not `PAL_NPC_GREEN`
- [maps/Route44.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route44.asm): `TrainerPokemaniacZach` should use `PAL_NPC_BLUE`, not `PAL_NPC_GREEN`
- [maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm): `TrainerCooltrainermNick` should use `SPRITE_COOLTRAINER_M`, not `SPRITE_ROCKER`
- [maps/FuchsiaPokecenter1F.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/FuchsiaPokecenter1F.asm): `FuchsiaPokecenter1FNurseScript` should use `PAL_NPC_RED`, not `PAL_NPC_GREEN`
- [maps/IlexForest.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/IlexForest.asm): `TrainerBugCatcherWayne` should use `SPRITE_BUG_CATCHER` and `PAL_NPC_BROWN`, not `SPRITE_YOUNGSTER` and `PAL_NPC_GREEN`

Most of the NPCs in [maps/NationalParkBugContest.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/NationalParkBugContest.asm) and [maps/Route36NationalParkGate.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route36NationalParkGate.asm) are also inconsistent with their trainers from other maps:

- `BugCatchingContestant1AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant1BScript`: `BUG_CATCHER DON` from [maps/Route30.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route30.asm) should use `SPRITE_BUG_CATCHER` and `PAL_NPC_BROWN`, not `SPRITE_YOUNGSTER` and `PAL_NPC_RED`
- `BugCatchingContestant2AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant2BScript`: `BUG_CATCHER ED` from [maps/Route2.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route2.asm) should use `SPRITE_BUG_CATCHER` and `PAL_NPC_BROWN`, not `SPRITE_YOUNGSTER` and `PAL_NPC_GREEN`
- `BugCatchingContestant3AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant3BScript`: `COOLTRAINERM NICK` from [maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm) should use `SPRITE_COOLTRAINER_M` and `PAL_NPC_RED`, not `SPRITE_ROCKER` and `PAL_NPC_BLUE`
- `BugCatchingContestant4AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant4BScript`: `POKEFANM WILLIAM` from [maps/NationalPark.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/NationalPark.asm) should use `PAL_NPC_RED`, not `PAL_NPC_BROWN`
- `BugCatchingContestant5AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant5BScript`: `BUG_CATCHER BENNY` from [maps/AzaleaGym.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/AzaleaGym.asm) should use `SPRITE_BUG_CATCHER` and `PAL_NPC_BROWN`, not `SPRITE_YOUNGSTER` and `PAL_NPC_RED`
- `BugCatchingContestant7AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant7BScript`: `PICNICKER CINDY` from [maps/FuchsiaGym.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/FuchsiaGym.asm) should use `PAL_NPC_GREEN`, not `PAL_NPC_BLUE`
- `BugCatchingContestant8AScript` and `BugCatchingContestant8BScript`: `BUG_CATCHER JOSH` from [maps/AzaleaGym.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/AzaleaGym.asm) should use `SPRITE_BUG_CATCHER` and `PAL_NPC_BROWN`, not `SPRITE_YOUNGSTER` and `PAL_NPC_RED`

(Note that [maps/Route8.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/Route8.asm) has three `BIKER`s, `DWAYNE`, `HARRIS`, and `ZEKE`, that use `PAL_NPC_RED`, `PAL_NPC_GREEN`, and `PAL_NPC_BLUE` instead of `PAL_NPC_BROWN`; this is intentional since they're the "Kanto Pokémon Federation".)

(The use of `SPRITE_ROCKER` instead of `SPRITE_COOLTRAINER_M` for `COOLTRAINERM NICK` may also be an intentional reference to the player's brother from the [Space World '97 beta](https://github.com/pret/pokegold-spaceworld).)


### Tackle is missing part of its hit animation

Copying two rows causes `BATTLE_BG_EFFECT_TACKLE` to hit the horizontal sprite limit. This fix restores the animation to copy only one row like in Pokémon Gold and Silver.

**Fix:** Edit `BattleAnim_Tackle` in [data/moves/animations.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/data/moves/animations.asm):

### Daisy's grooming doesn't always increase happiness

Subtracting `$FF` from `$FF` fails to set the carry flag, which results in a 0.4% chance that Daisy's grooming will not affect your Pokémon's happiness.

This is a bug with `HaircutOrGrooming` in [engine/events/haircut.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/events/haircut.asm):

```asm

### Magikarp in Lake of Rage are shorter, not longer

`cp HIGH(1024)` should be `cp 3`, since 1024 mm = 3'4", but `HIGH(1024)` = 4.

**Fix:** Edit `LoadEnemyMon.CheckMagikarpArea` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 .CheckMagikarpArea:
-; BUG: Magikarp in Lake of Rage are shorter, not longer (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

 	jr c, .Happiness

 	ld a, [wMagikarpLength]
-	cp HIGH(1024)
+	cp 3
 	jr c, .GenerateDVs ; try again
```


### Magikarp length limits have a unit conversion error

- `cp HIGH(1536)` should be `cp 5`, since 1536 mm = 5'0", but `HIGH(1536)` = 6.
- `cp LOW(1616)` should be `cp 4`, since 1616 mm = 5'4", but `LOW(1616)` = 80.
- `cp LOW(1600)` should be `cp 3`, since 1600 mm = 5'3", but `LOW(1600)` = 64.

**Fix:** Edit `LoadEnemyMon.CheckMagikarpArea` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 ; Get Magikarp's length
-; BUG: Magikarp length limits have a unit conversion error (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
 	ld de, wEnemyMonDVs
 	ld bc, wPlayerID

 	jr nz, .CheckMagikarpArea

 ; 5% chance of skipping both size checks
 	call Random
 	cp 5 percent
 	jr c, .CheckMagikarpArea
 ; Try again if length >= 1616 mm (i.e. if LOW(length) >= 4 inches)
 	ld a, [wMagikarpLength + 1]
-	cp LOW(1616)
+	cp 4
 	jr nc, .GenerateDVs

 ; 20% chance of skipping this check
 	call Random
 	cp 20 percent - 1
 	jr c, .CheckMagikarpArea
 ; Try again if length >= 1600 mm (i.e. if LOW(length) >= 3 inches)
 	ld a, [wMagikarpLength + 1]
-	cp LOW(1600)
+	cp 3
 	jr nc, .GenerateDVs
```

**Better fix:** Rewrite the whole system to use millimeters instead of feet and inches, since they have better precision (1 in = 25.4 mm); and only convert from metric to imperial units for display purposes (or don't, of course).


### Magikarp lengths can be miscalculated

**Fix:** Edit `CalcMagikarpLength.BCLessThanDE` in [engine/events/magikarp.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/events/magikarp.asm):

### `CheckOwnMon` only checks the first five letters of OT names

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVTTmReM4nQ))

This bug can allow you to talk to Eusine in Celadon City and encounter Ho-Oh with only traded legendary beasts.

**Fix:** Edit `CheckOwnMon` in [engine/pokemon/search_owned.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/pokemon/search_owned.asm):

```diff

### `CheckOwnMonAnywhere` does not check the Day-Care

*This may have been intentional behavior; use your own judgment for whether to fix it.*

This bug can prevent you from talking to Eusine in Celadon City or encountering Ho-Oh when a caught legendary beast is in the Day-Care.

**Fix:** Edit `CheckOwnMonAnywhere` in [engine/pokemon/search_owned.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/pokemon/search_owned.asm):

### The unused `phonecall` script command may crash

The `phonecall` script command calls the `PhoneCall` routine, which calls the `BrokenPlaceFarString` routine; this switches banks without being in bank 0, so it would start running arbitrary data as code.

**Fix:** Edit `PhoneCall.CallerTextboxWithName` in [engine/phone/phone.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/phone/phone.asm):

```diff
-; BUG: The unused phonecall script command may crash (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

 	ld a, [wPhoneCaller]

 	ld a, [wPhoneCaller + 1]
 	ld d, a

You can also delete the now-unused `BrokenPlaceFarString` routine in the same file.

### Saves corrupted by mid-save shutoff are not handled

([Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqtK0l6bu0), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2zHd1BPtvc))

This allows Pokémon to be duplicated, among other effects. It does not have a simple and accurate fix. A fix would involve redesigning parts of the save system for Pokémon boxes.


### `ScriptCall` can overflow `wScriptStack` and crash
